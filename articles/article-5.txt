A DETERMINED hobby farmer left paralysed by a car accident has designed a hoist so he can use his tractor again.

Martin Murphy, 37, lost the use of his legs when he suffered paralysis from the chest down following an accident while on his way to work as a carpenter in 2013.

n an effort to recover some independence, the dad of one designed a hoist to lift him into the tractor after seeing a similar engineering feat on TV.

“After I was paralysed, I spent three months in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dun Laoghaire which helped me hugely and made me realise and accept that I would never, ever walk again,” he said.

“But thankfully I still have the use of my hands and have also returned to doing a bit of carpentry. I’ve been making penal crosses for a priest up in Fermanagh.

“I also work hobby farming on my dad’s 100 acre beef farm and I wanted to get back into it but I’d literally have to haul myself into the tractor and rely on someone to help me out.”
