Plan for vending machines to give out free condoms in universities and pubs
'At risk' groups targeted in move to cut down on crisis pregnancies
Vending machines could be used to dispense free condoms in a drive to reduce crisis pregnancies and promote sexual health.

The HSE will provide free condoms in colleges and among "at risk" groups this year as the first step towards ensuring greater access to free contraception.

The installation of machines in pubs and clubs has emerged as one of the options to be investigated as the HSE researches the best way to more widely distribute the condoms.

Research will be carried out early in 2019 to determine the best way of distributing the condoms.
Increased availability of free contraceptives was one of the key recommendations made by the Oireachtas committee established to examine the issue of the Eighth Amendment. The committee also recommended improved sex education to reduce the instances of crisis pregnancy.

Funding has been released for the new initiatives in the revised estimates for the HSE's sexual health strategy for the coming year.

A survey on sexual health and crisis pregnancies in Ireland will also be carried out - almost a decade after the last one was completed.
