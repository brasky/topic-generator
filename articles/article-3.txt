JOHNNY FREE GOOD Nightclubbers to get free rubbers from vending machines under €500,000 safe sex plans backed by Health Minister Simon Harris
FREE condoms are to be made available in pubs and clubs under safe sex plans backed by Health Minister Simon Harris.
And cash will be allocated for installing vending machines in bars and clubs.

The details of their rollout are to be finalised by health officials.

The move comes after recommendations in the final report by the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment.

And we can reveal that Minister Harris wrote to the HSE saying the recommendations should form part of this year’s service plan.
